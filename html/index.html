  <h3>Ingredients</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>10 ounces of 60-62% bittersweet chocolate</li>
    <li>2 1/4 cups of unbleached all-purpose flour </li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon of baking powder</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon of baking soda</li>
    <li>3/4 teaspoon of kosher salt</li>
    <li>1 cup (90 grams) of unsweetened shredded coconut</li>
    <li>3/4 cup (150 grams) of granulated sugar</li>
    <li>3/4 cup (150 grams) of packed light brown sugar</li>
    <li>16 tablespoons (227 grams) unsalted butter room temperature</li>
    <li>1 large (50 grams) egg room temperature</li>
    <li>1 large (20 grams) egg yolk room temperature</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Cookie Instructions</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>Place the all-purpose flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and shredded coconut in a medium-sized bowl and
      whisk together for about 30 seconds to combine the ingredients.</li>
    <li>Place the granulated sugar, brown sugar, and butter in the bowl of a stand mixer.</li>
    <li>With the paddle attachment, mix on low speed for 30 seconds and then increase to medium speed and beat for 3
      minutes until the dough is creamy and lighter in color. Scrape down the bottom and sides of the bowl. Scrape the
      dough off the paddle attachment.</li>
    <li>Add the whole egg and the egg yolk and mix on medium speed for about 30 seconds until it is well incorporated
      and the dough looks creamy. Add the vanilla extract and mix on medium speed until it's incorporated, about 15
      seconds. Scrape the bottom and the sides of the bowl</li>
    <li>Add the dry ingredients to the dough all at once and mix on low speed until the flour is fully incorporated.
      Stop the mixer, add 8 ounces of bittersweet chocolate mix on low until the chocolate is distributed throughout the
      dough. Reserve the remaining chocolate to top the cookies right before they go in the oven.</li>
    <li>Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl and the paddle attachment to ensure the dough is fully mixed and to
      mix in any flour that is on the sides of the bowl.</li>
    <li>Scrape the dough into a smaller bowl and refrigerate the dough for at least 1 hour and ideally for 24 hours. The
      dough can be refrigerated for up to 3 days.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line two half baking sheets with parchment paper. If you only have one baking
      sheet, always wait until the baking sheet has completely cooled before placing raw cookie dough on the baking
      sheet.</li>
    <li>Scoop 2 tablespoons (30 grams) of the cookie dough and place them in a 3-2-3-2 pattern on the cookie sheet about
      2-inches apart. An easy way to scoop the cookies is to use a #40 cookie scoop, which holds about 2 tablespoons.
      Place 2 or 3 pieces of the reserved 2 ounces of chocolate on top of the unbaked cookie.</li>
    <li>Bake the cookies for 10-11 minutes until the edges are light golden brown. Remove the cookies from the oven and
      let cool on the baking sheet for 3 minutes before moving the cookies to a wire rack to finish cooling.</li>
    <li>If you want perfectly round cookies as soon as the cookies come out of the oven place a round cookie cutter
      around one of the cookies on the baking sheet. (It should be bigger than the cookie, and therefore not cut off any
      of the edges.) Then, use the cookie cutter to mold the edges of the cookie from uneven to perfectly round, using a
      swirling motion</li>
    <li>Store the cookies in an airtight container for up to 5 days.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Cookie Notes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li> Weighing Ingredients: Using a scale to weigh the flour, coconut, and unsalted butter will give you the most
      consistent results. Too much flour and the cookies will be a little dry. Too little flour and the cookies will
      spread too much.</li>
    <li>
      Baking the Cookies: Let the baking sheets cool in between batches of cookies. Placing the cookie dough on a warm
      baking sheet will cause the cookies to spread too much when baked.</li>
    <li>
      Substitutions: If you prefer you can use Milk Chocolate chips or chunks instead of bittersweet chocolate. The
      cookie will be sweeter.</li>
  </ul>
